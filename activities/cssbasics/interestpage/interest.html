        I enjoy DOTA 2 because of its deep stragy and ever-changing gameplay. With over 100 different characters and countless item combinations, every math feels different and exciting. The need for quick decisions and teamwork keeps me engaged and constantly learning, making each game both challenging and rewarding.

        Another reason which draws me to Dota 2 is every second of the match is competetitive and requires high speed reaction and control over all aspect of the game. Dota 2 requires both strategy and quick reaction from the player for every second of it.
