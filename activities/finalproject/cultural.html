           <p>Mongolian horse is one of the highlights of the Naadam Festival, showcasing the strength and endurance of Mongolia's iconic horses. Unlike traditional races, these events cover long distances, often 15-30 kilometers across open terrain. Riders, usually children aged 6-13, guide their horses with incredible skill. The focus is on the horse's performance, celebrating the deep bond between Mongolians and our resilient steeds.</p>
